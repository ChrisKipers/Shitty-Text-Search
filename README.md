# Shitty Text Search
## The worlds most shitty free text search engine

Shitty text search(STS) is a toy project so that I can get more familiar with c++ and implement some text retrieval algorithms.
You can use this project if you must, just know if you do, you make terrible life decisions. Alternatives to STS
are [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

If you are mentally ill and insist on using STS, then the following instructions are for you. To start STS, run main with
the directory you want to use as your corpus. The documents in the directory must be text documents, not PDFs, word docs, ect.
STS will then prompt you for queries until you type "exit()";

STS api and behavior are ever changing, you have been warned!
